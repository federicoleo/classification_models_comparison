This notebook tries to analyze and extract information form a large dataset regarding supply chain business from DataCo company.
The dataset holds several features, ranging from revenues to cateogory of items bought per customer.
<br />
Our goal was to extract useful information about the overwiev of the businesses and to analyze fraud suspicion.
<br />
In particular, several classification models have been utilized to perform prediction about frauds detection,
then comparing them in order to analyze their performances.

### Classification Models used are:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Trees
